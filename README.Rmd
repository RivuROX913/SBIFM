## Installation

You can install the development version of SBIFM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RivuROX913/SBIFM")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(SBIFM)
## basic example code

## Generate synthetic data
data = generateData(n = 200, p = 50, k = 10, rep = 5)
##analysis
out = GibbsCov(data, 20000, 5000, 3, 1e-4)


# Load the data
data <- psych::bfi[, 1:25]

head(data)
#diagnose for missing value
dlookr::diagnose(data)
visdat::vis_miss(data, sort_miss = FALSE)
#imputation
mice_model <- mice::mice(data, method='pmm', seed = 123)
data_complete <- mice::complete(mice_model)

visdat::vis_miss(data_complete, sort_miss = FALSE)


##analysis
datalist = list( "data" = data_complete, "replicate" = 1, "n" = nrow(data_complete), "p" = ncol(data_complete) )

out = GibbsCov(datalist, 20000, 5000, 3, 1e-4)


```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
